# Logs Folder

This folder serves as "project memory" - tracking what was done and when, without being formal documentation.

## Purpose

Unlike formal documentation in `docs/`, the logs folder contains:
- Chronological task tracking
- Quick notes about decisions made
- Work-in-progress items
- Informal progress updates

## Contents

### task-log.md
A chronological log of completed and in-progress tasks. This helps:
- Track scope and progress over time
- Identify workload patterns
- Remember what was done when
- Estimate time for similar future tasks

## Logging Guidelines

- **Be Concise**: Logs are for quick reference, not detailed explanations
- **Be Chronological**: Add entries in date order
- **Include Context**: Note why decisions were made, not just what was done
- **Update Regularly**: Don't let the log get stale

## Example Entry Format

```
## 2024-01-15
- [x] Implemented user authentication endpoints
- [x] Created database models for users and exercises
- [ ] Started work on workout session logging
  - Note: Need to decide on set/rep/weight data structure
```
