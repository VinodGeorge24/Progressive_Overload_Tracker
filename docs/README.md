# Documentation Folder

This folder contains longer-form documentation that supports the project, including class deliverables, research notes, and presentation material.

## Contents

### project-log.md
Chronological log of project decisions and doc updates. Each entry can include a human-readable summary and an agent-friendly (structured) summary. Starts from 2/18/26.

### weekly-reports/
One file per week summarizing progress. These are used directly for weekly emails/meetings with your professor.

**Format**: `week-YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `week-N.md`

Each report should include:
- What was accomplished during the week
- Challenges encountered
- Plans for the next week
- Any questions or blockers

### research-notes.md
Notes related to the research angle of the project, including:
- Progress metrics and visualization (volume, weight/reps per set; per-exercise charts)
- Volume calculations and chart approach (Python backend, Option A)
- Plateau detection and recommendations are in the Future section (not current scope)
- References to academic papers or resources

### screenshots/
Images of the UI, charts, or workflows. These are used later for:
- Final paper
- User manual
- Presentation slides
- Demo videos

**Note**: Keep file sizes reasonable. Use descriptive filenames like `login-screen.png`, `progress-chart-week-4.png`, etc.

## Organization Tips

- Keep weekly reports chronological
- Update research notes as you develop algorithms
- Take screenshots at key milestones
- Document decisions and rationale here, not just in code comments
