"""
Shared API dependencies.

Place shared dependencies here (e.g. get_current_user) when auth is implemented.
Do not stub with return None — that silently passes and hides missing auth.
When adding get_current_user, either leave unimplemented or raise NotImplementedError
so accidental use fails loudly.
