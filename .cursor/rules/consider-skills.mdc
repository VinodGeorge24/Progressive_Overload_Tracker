# Consider Skills Before Acting

Before answering or implementing:

1. **Check available skills** (project and global). Use each skill’s **description** to see if it matches the request.
2. **If a skill applies**, follow that skill’s instructions (e.g. spec-to-plan → produce the full plan before coding).
3. **If none apply**, proceed as usual.

This is efficient: descriptions are short and matching is a single mental step. It avoids skipping workflows (like planning before coding) when a skill exists for them.
