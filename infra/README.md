# Infrastructure

Use `docker compose up -d` in this directory to start PostgreSQL locally. Backend and frontend run locally (see `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for setup).

**This compose file is for local development only.** Production uses hosted Postgres (e.g. Supabase, Render, Railway).
